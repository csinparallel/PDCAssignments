# PDC Assignments

This repository provides starter code for assignments that have been useful for teaching parallel and distributed computing (PDC) in various classroom settings.

- **Boids** provides alternate methods of visualizing autonomous agents caled bird-oids, or boids, that exhibit flocking behavior.

- **CircuitSolver** parallelizes a 32-bit version of the 16-bit circuit solving problem from "Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP", by Michael Quinn.

- **ForestFire** uses parallelism to speed up a Monte Carlo analysis of a forest fire's behavior.

- **HeatDiffusion** uses parallelism to speed up the visualization of heat being conducted through a planar surface.

- **ImageProcessing-TSGL** uses the thread safe graphics library to explore the use of multithreading to accelerate image-processing in real time.

- **LinearAlgebra** uses parallelism to speed up linear algebra problems, such as matrix operations.

- **Mandelbrot** uses parallelism to speed up the classic Mandelbrot set computation.

- **PinFinder** uses parallelism to accelerate the solution to a cybersecurity problem: given the hash of an employee's personal identification number (PIN), retrieve their PIN.
