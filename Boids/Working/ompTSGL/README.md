This is some starting code based on an original code from a book:

From a book called “The computational beauty of nature.” https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/computational-beauty-nature

See the description in the Google Drive projects folder for the course. This code has been modified from the original, where many global variables were used (a practice we no longer use).
